<h1>Rainbow.js</h1>
<div id="repl"></div>
<p>(The "Eval" button is just there in case pressing enter doesn't
  work for you. I run into this kind of snafu on mobile devices.)</p>
<p>Above is a REPL for Rainbow.js, an implementation of most of
  Rainbow, which is an implemenation of Arc. By default, we don't load
  arc.arc or friends automatically yet, but you can enter
  <code>(load-from-web)</code> to load them manually or
  <a href="#libs">put "#libs" on the end of the URI</a> to refresh the
  page such that the libraries are loaded automatically.</p>
  
<p>I've modified rainbow/rainbow-libs.arc so that even if you load it,
  it won't load these libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rainbow/welder.arc</li>
  <li>rainbow/fsb.arc</li>
  <li>rainbow/tetris.arc</li>
  <li>rainbow/mines.arc</li>
</ul>
<p>All the Arc code is still written as though Java libraries were
  present, so these wouldn't be very useful anyway.</p>
<p>In any case, now that we're actually loading libraries,
  Java Rainbow's performance outpaces Rainbow.js's. Ah well. :-p</p>
<p>(To test its performance, I recommend removing network request time
  from the equation by loading index.html from the local filesystem.
  However, the requests to relative paths (for the Arc files) count as
  cross-origin, so I use Chrome's <code>--disable-web-security</code>
  flag for the test. I don't know of a similar option on other
  browsers.)
<h3>Doing JavaScript things</h3>
<p>Besides <code>load-from-web</code>, this REPL defines another
  global: <code>window</code>, the page's window object. You can use
  it with <code>java-invoke</code> like so (assuming no libraries
  loaded):</p>
<pre>
arc> (assign list (fn a a))
(fn a a)
arc>
  (assign jsget-impl
    (java-invoke
      window 'eval (list "(function ( o, k ) { return o[ k ]; })")))

function ( o, k ) { return o[ k ]; }
arc>
  (assign jsget
    (fn (o k) (java-invoke jsget-impl 'call (list nil o k))))

(fn (o k) (java-invoke jsget-impl 'call (list nil o k)))
arc> (jsget window "Object")
function Object() { [native code] }
</pre>
<p>You <i>could</i> do crazy meta-things this way, like calling parts
  of Rainbow.js's implementation. However, all the JavaScript code
  this page uses is minified, so good luck with that. :-p</p>
<p>Rainbow.js (like Java Rainbow) takes care of some simple type
  conversions for you, like converting native strings to Arc
  strings:</p>
<pre>
arc>
  (+ "The title of the page is: "
     (jsget (jsget window "document") "title"))

"The title of the page is: It's Rainbow in JavaScript!"
</pre>
<p>I'm not sure I actually like that automatic conversion, since I'd
  rather define my own conversion rules as a library. I'm also not
  sure it's really appropriate to call <code>java-invoke</code> the
  same thing as it's called in Java Rainbow. In some ways, Rainbow.js
  may be staying a bit too true to the original. ^_^</p>
